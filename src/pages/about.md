## who? me?

I was a child of the pre-social network internet, so I always had always been interesting in mucking about with programming, this ultimately culminated in studying Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Conneticut.  Which really just means I studied Computer Science and can read circuit diagrams as well.

My current gig is working as a Software Consultant at Tallan Inc. in Glastonbury, CT.

So, I'm a programmer by trade and have putzed around with some design and hardware work in my spare time.

My ongoing passion project is [Tono](https://mattia.id/projects.html), a cart based digital music player.  It's a pretty dumb idea, but I really love working on it.
