Hey everyone, my name is boldly emblazoned at the top of this page.  You might also find some of my stuff typically under the [lame] username Matteron.

I've done a bad job at collecting previous works on the web in a permanent way in the past so this site is gonna try and rectify that.

Anyway, enjoy my ~~useless vanity project~~ personal site.
