## Haipa (ハイパー)
###### January 14, 2020

Haipa is a quick little project to make writing HTML a bit quicker and less painful (I really hate writing all those tags twice). I'm sure something like this has been done before, I just couldn't find it, so I built my own.

The initial prototype was done in about 5 minutes, then spent the rest of that day porting my static site over to give Haipa a semi realistic test.
